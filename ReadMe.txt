GCLA - La Palma Airport -third version-
----------------------------------------

How to install the scenery?

Copy or unzip all files and put it in the following directory:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w020n20 -> w018n28

Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "2661792" otherwise it won't work later.
In addition please delete all old files of La Palma v.2 in the directory named wo18n28 because all scenery 
objects are now in a separate folder.

Have fun with many flights to La Palma Airport.

If there are question or problems you can mail me in Lukas' Flightgear Hangar.
